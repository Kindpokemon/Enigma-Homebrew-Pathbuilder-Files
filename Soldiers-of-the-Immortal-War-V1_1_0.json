You summon a copy of any one common item as long as its price is less than or equal to 100 times your level and its volume is less that 1 cubic foot times your level. The item remains for 1 minute, after which it returns automatically to the First Vault. Consumable items vanish once used, but any effects last for their normal duration or 1 minute, whichever is lower.

Abusing this power can result in losing Abadar’s favor until you atone, during which you cannot perform this action. Using this ability to counter unfair trade and theft is allowable, but still often frowned upon as it allows holy items of Abadar to enter the hands of thieves and swindlers.<br><br>Because there is only one perfect copy of each item in the First Vault, you must roll a d100 each time you use this ability.
